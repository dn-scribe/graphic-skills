# Coloring Book Generator

Use this skill to generate a printable coloring book with multiple pages, black and white line art with thick lines, transparent backgrounds, and a Markdown file that records the prompts and picture plan used for reproduction.

You can also provide a sample image as a style reference during generation.

## When To Use It

Use this skill when the user asks for any of the following:

- a themed coloring book
- coloring pages with a transparent background
- printable coloring pages
- a specific number of pages in a coloring book
- black and white line art suitable for coloring
- a reproducible prompt log for image generation
- OpenAI or Gemini / Nano Banana image generation
- consistent style across multiple coloring pages

## Workflow

1. Collect the required inputs:
   - `theme`: may be a short theme or a long prompt string
   - `style`: may be a short style or a long prompt string (optional, defaults to "simple line art")
   - `pages`: number of pages to generate (default to 5)
   - `reference_image`: optional reference picture for style consistency
   - `constraints`: optional hard requirements to apply across all pages; pass multiple `--constraint` flags
2. If needed, install local prerequisites:

```bash
bash skills/coloring-book-generator/scripts/install.sh
```

3. Run the bundled script:

```bash
python3 skills/coloring-book-generator/scripts/generate_coloring_book.py \
  --theme 'Underwater adventure with friendly sea creatures' \
  --style "simple line art, thick black outlines, minimal detail" \
  --constraint "square composition" \
  --constraint "all characters are smiling" \
  --pages 5 \
  --output-dir tmp
```

4. Confirm the outputs:
   - `<theme-slug>-<timestamp>-page-001.jpg` through `<theme-slug>-<timestamp>-page-XXX.jpg`
   - `<theme-slug>-<timestamp>-plan.md`

To use a local style reference image:

```bash
python3 skills/coloring-book-generator/scripts/generate_coloring_book.py \
  --theme 'Underwater adventure with friendly sea creatures' \
  --style "simple line art, thick black outlines, minimal detail" \
  --reference-image /absolute/path/to/reference.png \
  --constraint "square composition" \
  --constraint "submarine windows are round" \
  --pages 5 \
  --output-dir tmp
```

Example with multiple structural constraints:

```bash
python3 skills/coloring-book-generator/scripts/generate_coloring_book.py \
  --theme 'Happy Sukkot family scenes for young kids' \
  --reference-image /absolute/path/to/sukkah-reference.png \
  --constraint "square pictures" \
  --constraint "the sukkah roof is flat with a horizontal top edge" \
  --constraint "kids are smiling" \
  --pages 5 \
  --output-dir tmp
```

To use Gemini / Nano Banana instead of OpenAI:

```bash
python3 skills/coloring-book-generator/scripts/generate_coloring_book.py \
  --provider gemini \
  --theme 'Underwater adventure with friendly sea creatures' \
  --style "simple line art, thick black outlines, minimal detail" \
  --pages 5 \
  --output-dir tmp
```

Gemini also supports the same `--reference-image` option.

## Replay From Markdown

If you want to iterate from a previous run, edit the generated Markdown file and rerun with:

```bash
python3 skills/coloring-book-generator/scripts/generate_coloring_book.py \
  --replay-from-md tmp/your-theme-20260317-120000-plan.md \
  --output-dir tmp
```

Editable sections that affect the rerun:

- `Theme`
- `Style`
- `Constraints`
- `Reference image`
- `Number of pages`
- `Provider`
- `Picture Descriptions`
- `Generated Image Prompts`
- `Planner model`
- `Image model`

If `Generated Image Prompts` are present, the script uses them directly. If you remove those blocks, the script rebuilds the image prompts from the edited theme, style, and picture descriptions.

## Character Consistency for Storylines

**Enhanced Planning**: The script now specifically identifies and tracks main characters across pages:

```bash
python3 skills/coloring-book-generator/scripts/generate_coloring_book.py \
  --theme "Princess Luna (golden braided hair, blue star dress, silver crown) and Spark the dragon (small, purple, orange wings) explore a magical castle" \
  --pages 4 \
  --output-dir tmp
```

**Character-Focused Themes**: For best results, include detailed character descriptions in your theme:
- **Physical features**: hair color/style, clothing, distinctive accessories
- **Character names**: helps maintain identity across pages
- **Relationships**: how characters interact (friends, pets, siblings)

**What The Script Does

- **Character extraction**: Automatically identifies main characters from the theme and creates detailed descriptions for consistency
- Uses a text model to turn the theme and style inputs into:
  - an exact picture list for each page that advances a cohesive storyline
  - detailed character descriptions that get included in all image prompts
  - detailed image-generation prompts for each page
- Uses the image model to generate the first picture as a style and character reference
- **Enhanced character consistency**: All subsequent pages include character descriptions and use the first page as visual reference
- **Parallel generation**: After the first page, generates remaining pages in parallel for faster completion
- **Pure black and white**: Generates images with only pure black lines on white background, no gray colors or shading
- **Robust error handling**: If a page fails to generate (e.g., content policy violation), the script:
  - Skips that page and continues with remaining pages
  - Reports failed pages at the end with specific error messages
  - Documents failures in the markdown plan for future reference
- Exports each successful page as a separate JPEG file
- Writes a Markdown log with the user inputs, generated picture descriptions, model names, prompts used, and any failures
- Supports `--provider openai` and `--provider gemini` (experimental)
- Defaults to OpenAI for maximum reliability

## Requirements

- **For image generation**: `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OPEN_AI_TOKEN` must be set (required for all runs since only OpenAI supports image generation)
- **For planning**: `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` can be set to use Gemini for planning (optional)
- This skill currently targets macOS because it relies on `sips`
- `scripts/install.sh` bootstraps Homebrew and Python 3 if needed, then verifies the Apple toolchain

## Notes

- **Performance**: After generating the first page for reference, remaining pages are generated in parallel (up to 3 concurrent requests) for faster completion
- **Pure black and white**: All images use only pure black lines on white background with absolutely no gray colors, shading, or gradients
- **Complete framing**: All coloring pages ensure that characters, objects, and scene elements are fully contained within page boundaries with no cropped or cut-off elements
- The first generated image is used as a style reference for all subsequent pages to maintain consistency
- **Error resilience**: The script gracefully handles content policy violations and API errors by skipping problematic pages while continuing to generate the rest
- Failed pages are clearly reported at the end with specific error messages and documented in the plan file
- **Default**: The script uses OpenAI for both planning and image generation by default (most reliable)
- **Gemini option**: Use `--provider gemini` for planning only (experimental), but image generation will still use OpenAI since Gemini doesn't support image generation
- If the user wants revisions, rerun the script with adjusted `theme`, `style`, or `pages`
- Each page is saved as a separate file to allow for individual printing or use
